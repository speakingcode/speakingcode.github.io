I have a new goal for myself. I want to spend 1 hour a day doing focused reading on a book, anbd 1 hour a day doing some kind of learning and practice, which I will probably focus on music and creative media for a while. This is separate from online tutorials and work related learning. I need to read novels and other subjects and keep my mind expanding.

I've put it out there, this is my verbal *contract* with the universe, as documented here. I **have** to fulfill this obligation now.
