After several weeks of downtime I finally got around to bringing my site back up. I'm moving off Wordpress and I'm now using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the Ruby-based static site generator. I haven't played with it much but I like it. And boy do I love ruby... I'll migrate old posts over time, but I think I'm gonna change the tone and style of this blog, make it a little more general and... personal... so expect some mad shennanigans soon.


My head is exploding with ideas.
